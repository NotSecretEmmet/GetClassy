# Time to get classy

## General info:
Credit for original idea belongs to: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ca4bl/time_to_get_classy/.

Hobby project created for entertainment purposes.
Use when it's 'time to get classy'.

Instead of manually opening all the tabs to 'set the mood', I wanted to have it done automatically using Selenium.


Additionally, I added the feature to play/cast the fire place video to a chromecast.


## Technologies:
Project created with Python 3.8
Packages used:

    - selenium
    
    - webdriver_manager
    
    - pychromecast


## Setup:
-pip install requirements.txt

-Change the 'CAST_NAME' variable to match the name of your target Chromecast (or leave blank to skip)

-Run


## Disclaimer:
Has not been tested to 'set the mood' in any romantic situations as of yet.
Warning: have received mixed reactions when tested on friends.
